## About the User 
- The ideal user for this application is a student.
- They want to know what house they will be sorted into.

## Features 
- When a new student is submitted to the form they are added as an object to the student array.
- They are randomly assigned to a house.
- House buttons filter depending on what house each student is in.
- If a student is expelled their card gets moved to the other array of Death Eaters.
